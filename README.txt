Custom version of Mark Nelson's "mod_certificate". Adds a "Second page" to the original certificate plugin, which can be customized by the teacher.

We've added a new layout (TRT) which includes a second page, meant to be printed on the back of the certificate. The text of the certificate can also be modified in the "Text Options" tab, which was not possible before. Also included is a "Pre-visualization" button, to see the changes to the certificate layout.

Main new features:
* A new panel where you can customize the certificate second page
* Option to automatically print subjects and workload in the second page
* A new field "column picture" for customizing the "column" on the left side of the certificate
* A new "Pre-visualization" button, in "Design Options"
* Also included is a new layout which supports these new features
